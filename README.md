# Circles


Circles is a Data Centric, user friendly full stack website. 

Circles enables users to easily create a simple database of their family circles. It will be focused on building 
a family circle around a chosen person, from parents and siblings to spouse and children. While automatically maintaining
the correct relationships involved. This process can then be repeated as often as required for different people.
This will result in a comprehensive data structure of overlapping circles, representing the users family history 
and relationships. Key to this will be that the user will feel that they have had to put no thought into the structure
and layout.  

Users will be able to perform CRUD on the database, via a simple, intuitive front end web page.

This project will be submitted for my Python and Data Centric Development, and third milestone project, in my Full Stack Software Development Diploma. 
The project is a working full-stack site that allows users to manage a
common dataset. It will also demonstrate the technologies I have learned so far.
