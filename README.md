# Circles



Circles is a Data Centric, user friendly full stack website. 

</div>

Circles enables users to easily create a simple database of their family circles. It will be focused on building 
a family circle around a chosen person, from parents and siblings to spouse and children. While automatically maintaining
the correct relationships involved. This process can then be repeated as often as required for different people.
This will result in a comprehensive data structure of overlapping circles, representing the users family history 
and relationships. Key to this will be that the user will feel that they have had to put no thought into the structure
and layout.  

Users will be able to perform CRUD on the database, via a simple, intuitive front end web page.

This project will be submitted for my Python and Data Centric Development, and third milestone project, in my Full Stack Software Development Diploma. 
The project is a working full-stack site that allows users to manage a
common dataset. It will also demonstrate the technologies I have learned so far.

# UX

## Purpose and Goals

Circles is a web based application, designed to help the user build a family tree - or Circle!  

There are many Genealogy building websites available today, and many of my friends , as well as myself have tried many of them. And whereas their complexity and effort to cover all 
bases is to be admired, i have found that in that effort lies a flaw for the casual user.   
The problem is, that their must be a tradeoff when building an application that covers every sort of eventuality, the trade is ease of use.  
My experience of friends and family is that from first click, the interface either appears impossibly daunting, or impossible to understand. 
The user is forced into making decisions about how they should structure their data, "Do i start with a person or a family?" 
and left wondering what an event should include, or a citation should be.  

So the goal of the website is to fulfil a simple need for people to know and document their family - Simply. It wont cover every base, and there wont
be fancy graphs - To start with anyway.   
What Circles will provide is simplicity of use, a simple guided building structure built around the model of a family being a circle, comprising
of one person at its hub. The circle will comprise of, Parents, Siblings, Spuse/key-Partner, and children, all displayed on one page.  
This will also allow a user to click on any of the other people within this circle, to put them at the hub of their own family page. Each family circle page, will contain information about the "Hub" person
and in this way, will replace all the awkward confusing entries requested by more complex family tree builders.

This is also complemented by a search feature on the home page allowing you to jump to any person you have created within the database. 
I have chosen this design, as i feel that this is what common people like me want from a genealogy building tool, to keep a track of family connections and information.

## User Stories
The Application is intended for users of any age who are deciding on a location for their mini-break, or even just a day out.


The following user stories have been identified:

1.  As a user, I want the home screen to be simple with a clear indication of what im supposed to do. 
2.  As a user, I want to be able to enter my own family tree information.
3.  As a user, I want a simple way to enter a new person.
4.  As a user, I dont want to have to think about how to connect people in the family circle.
5.  As a user, I want to be able to search my family for a specific person
6.  As a user, I want to be able to see my parental lineage within the database.
